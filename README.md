## Welcome
This group project by [Isaac Detert](https://github.com/CottonpuffProgrammer) and [Rene Hernandez](https://github.com/ReneProgramming), is a data driven project that also implements <br/>
some CRUD functionality as well as Source Control. We have chosen to do a schedule management project.
<br/>

## Main Form

<br/>
This is the main form, this displays your schedule showing the date of the event, the name, and the location.<br/>
On this form it displays three buttons, Update Schedule display will show your new schedule after you have added or deleted an event.<br/>
The add event button will take you to another form where you will be able to add to your schedule.<br/>
The delete event button will take you to another form where you will be able to choose a specific event to delete from your schedule.

## Add to schedule form

This is the add to schedule form, you can enter the name, location, and date of the event you would like to <br/>
add to your schedule. After you have entered the information, press the add button to store the event and <br/>
exit will take you back to the main form.

## Delete event form

the event selected and press the delete event to remove it from your schedule.
